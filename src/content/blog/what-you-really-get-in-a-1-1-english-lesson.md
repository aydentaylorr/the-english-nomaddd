Let’s be honest.

There are thousands of free apps, YouTube channels, grammar blogs, and AI chatbots out there claiming to help you learn English. And yes — they’re useful. I even recommend them to my own students sometimes.

But here’s the truth nobody tells you:

---

## None of them can do what a focused, one-on-one English lesson can do.
Not when it’s tailored. Not when it’s real. And not when it’s with someone who gets you, pushes you, and doesn’t let you hide behind your “I’m fine” smile.

Let’s break down what you actually get in a live session with me — Tam’s, The English Nomadd

### 1. You don’t just “practise” — you get corrected and coached
Apps let you speak. But do they stop you mid-sentence and say,
“Hold on — try it this way instead. That sounds more natural”?
I do.

Whether it’s your pronunciation, your grammar, or just sounding more confident — I hear it, I tweak it, and we go again. It’s not robotic. It’s human. It’s fast.

### 2. You speak more English in one lesson than in a whole week on your own
Let’s be real — “daily speaking practice” sounds great, but most learners… don’t do it.
One lesson with me? You’ll be talking, laughing, and messing up safely for a full hour.

And that’s where fluency lives.

### 3. You get a teacher who listens for what’s missing
Most learners don’t know what they don’t know. That’s my job.
I’ll notice if you avoid past tenses. If you use the same 10 words over and over. If you’re translating in your head. And I’ll fix it, kindly and clearly.

### 4. Every lesson is built around your English life
Work in finance? We’ll roleplay business calls.
Struggle with chit-chat? I’ve got questions that’ll get you talking in seconds.
Feel like your English is “stuck”? We’ll diagnose it and unlock it.

This isn’t textbook stuff. It’s your English, for your world.

### 5. You don’t just learn — you get supported
You can Google grammar. You can’t Google confidence.
And sometimes you just need a human who believes in you, corrects you gently, and says, “You’re doing better than you think.”

That’s what I bring to every session.

Ready to stop guessing and start growing?
You’ve probably learned a lot on your own — and that’s amazing.
But if you’re ready to level up, fix your mistakes faster, and actually enjoy speaking English…

Then I’d love to work with you.
