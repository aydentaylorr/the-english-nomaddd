Let’s face it — you don’t always have time for homework. Or energy. Or brainpower.
That’s normal.

But here’s the secret: keeping your English alive between lessons doesn’t have to mean 2 hours of grammar exercises or writing essays you’ll never look at again.

Small habits = big impact. 
Here are a few ways to keep your English warm (like a freshly brewed cup of tea):

---

## 1. Change your phone language
Sounds scary, but it’s low-effort, high-impact. You'll pick up daily vocabulary fast.

## 2. Use English for what you already love
- Love true crime? Watch The Crime Analyst in English.
- Into workouts? Try a fitness YouTuber in English.
- Like cooking? Watch Tasty or Sorted Food.

## 3. Narrate your life (quietly or out loud!)
While walking: “I’m walking to the bus. It’s cold. I should’ve worn my jacket.”
Silly? Maybe. Effective? Very.

## 4. Write to your future self
Try 3 lines a day in a journal:
“Today was okay. I felt nervous in my meeting. I’ll try to speak up tomorrow.”

## 5. Play “The Label Game”
Look at your shopping, receipts, clothing tags — everything. Translate or describe what you see in English.

Final Thoughts from Tam’s
English learning isn’t about big leaps. It’s about tiny nudges forward, every day.
Even when you’re tired. Even when you don’t feel like it.
You’re already doing more than you think.

Keep it going. I see you.
