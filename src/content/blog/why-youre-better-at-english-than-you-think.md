## Hey you — yes, you!

If you’re reading this and doubting your English, let me stop you right there.

One of the things I hear most from students is:

- “My English is so bad...”
- “I can understand everything but I freeze when I speak.”
- “I feel stupid when I try to explain myself.”

First of all: you are not stupid. You’re probably better at English than you think. In fact, I’m willing to bet that your real problem isn’t your English… it’s your confidence.

So let’s talk about that.

## You understand more than you give yourself credit for

If you can follow this blog post, guess what? You’re already working with B1/B2/C1-level English. Even if you don’t understand every word, your brain is doing something amazing — it’s filling in the gaps.

That’s real language power.  
Not perfect grammar.  
Not fancy vocab.  
Real-world understanding.

## You’ve probably already had more conversations than you think

I’ve had students tell me they “can’t speak,” and then ten minutes later we’re chatting about their job, their dog, or how weird English spelling is.

Just because you pause, search for a word, or make a grammar mistake doesn’t mean you’re not speaking. It means you're a normal human learning a language. And guess what? Native speakers do that too.

## Don’t let perfection be the enemy of progress

You don’t need to sound like the BBC. You need to be understood.  
You don’t need 100% fluency. You need courage to keep showing up.

When you let go of this idea of “perfect English,” something incredible happens:  
You start speaking more, laughing more, learning faster.

## Let’s check your real English level

Here’s a quick confidence checklist. How many of these can you tick off?

- I can understand the main idea of conversations, even with fast speakers
- I’ve had at least one awkward but successful English conversation
- I’ve sent a message or email in English
- I’ve watched a movie or YouTube video in English without subtitles (or with English subs)
- I’ve had a moment where I surprised myself with how well I spoke

**If you ticked 2 or more — congratulations, your English is working.  
If you ticked 4 or more — your English is already thriving.**

## Final thoughts from Tam’s

So the next time that little voice in your head says “Your English is rubbish,”  
I want you to answer it with:

> “Nope. My English is real, it's growing, and it's already good enough to get me where I want to go.”

And if you ever want someone to walk alongside you, celebrate the small wins, and keep things real — you know where to find me.
